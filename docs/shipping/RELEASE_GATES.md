# Verglos V1 release gates

## Gate 0 — Truth and scope

- Current capability registry reconciled with code/tests.
- Every command and plan has a shipped/partial/planned label.
- Open-core, premium content, third-party licenses, notices, and trademark boundaries reviewed.

## Gate 1 — Evidence correctness

- Subject identity is immutable and digest-bound.
- Native and imported observations preserve attribution.
- Duplicate, malformed, stale, and mismatched evidence tests pass.
- Engine absence/staleness yields `INCOMPLETE`, never false `PASS`.

## Gate 2 — Security and agent safety

- No target-code execution during ordinary scanning.
- Hunt recipes are signed, bounded, isolated, redacted, and network-denied by default.
- SSRF, path traversal, archive bomb, symlink, malformed input, resource exhaustion, webhook, and tenant-boundary tests pass.

## Gate 3 — Product and UX

- Local viewer answers release decision before deep evidence.
- Developer, lead, client, and procurement views are understandable without founder explanation.
- Keyboard, screen reader, contrast, reduced motion, and machine-readable alternatives pass.

## Gate 4 — Commercial and operations

- Server-side seats, quotas, retention, overages, billing, and modified-CLI tests pass.
- Idempotency, retries, dead letters, restore drill, rollback, alert delivery, and monitoring pass.
- Per-plan hosted COGS and support cost are measured; no unbounded managed execution exists.

## Gate 5 — Distribution and licensing

- Clean install/upgrade/rollback on supported macOS, Linux, and Windows architectures.
- Trusted npm provenance, dependency SBOM, `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES`, license validation, attribution, and modification notices are complete.
- Current state (2026-09-12): OPEN. LIC-001 and LIC-004 engineering acceptance is complete and CI-verified; CLI PR #34 self-scan and all nine Ubuntu/macOS/Windows Node 20/22/24 cells pass. Web PR #32 head `3544561` includes a scoped database facade, actor-bound organization-directory repository, and PostgreSQL authorization-resolver fixtures; local 79/79 tests pass; hosted run `34675067531`, GitGuardian, and Vercel pass. HOSTED-011 is accepted at the verified PR head. HOSTED-012 route-level actor/role-denial and cross-tenant response fixtures remain open; an experimental route mock was removed after Node 22 incompatibility. DIST-001 stays open behind LOCAL/HUNT/RECORD dependencies. Publishing remains fail-closed because the nested `benchmark@1.0.0` ISC/BSD-3-Clause conflict needs review; LIC-002 external content records, web redistribution review, release-note qualification, protected publish controls, and full amd64/arm64 install/rollback evidence remain open.

## Gate 6 — External acceptance

Current web update (2026-09-12): PR #32 head `3544561` is OPEN/MERGEABLE; hosted Node 22 run `34675067531`, GitGuardian, and Vercel pass. Local 79/79 tests with PostgreSQL, typecheck, schema/migration checks, and production build pass. HOSTED-011 remains accepted; HOSTED-012 remains open pending reliable route-level actor/role and cross-tenant response fixtures. No additional backlog item was checked; count is 155 unchecked / 114 checked / 269.

Web verification addendum (2026-09-12): PR #32 head `21c3b19` passes Node 22 run `34672637622`, including PostgreSQL integration, typecheck, full suite, schema/migration checks, build, public-boundary, dependency, and secret checks; GitGuardian and Vercel pass. HOSTED-011 is accepted at the verified PR head. HOSTED-012 route-level non-member/role-denial and existence-hiding evidence remains incomplete.

- Feature-complete release candidate tested against frozen public and authorized repositories/artifacts.
- Acceptance stories in `VERGLOS_FINAL_ACCEPTANCE_AND_POC.md` pass.
- Truth registry, docs, dashboard labels, pricing copy, and campaign claims updated only after evidence review.
