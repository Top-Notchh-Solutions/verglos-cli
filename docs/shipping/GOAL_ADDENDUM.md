# Goal addendum — 2026-10-07

The active Verglos V1 goal remains whole-product shipping, not a reduced
release. This batch records the latest PR #153 worker scope-fence correction:
head `ade21b6f4c74b0a27bcf349bded6d9ceb7e39ee0`, local focused 32/32 and
negative-boundary 2/2, hosted workflow `37560704115` green. The authoritative
backlog remains **218 checked / 62 unchecked / 280 total**.

The worker is still a contract, not accepted deletion capability. No production
or provider write, migration, deletion, payment, deployment, or browser
mutation occurred. The goal therefore remains active; the next dependency-ready
batch is the disposable-DB-backed user-scoped deletion job/store with explicit
reconciliation and restore evidence.

## 2026-10-07 batch update

PR #153 head `b91222a8d4d6ffd08f2be71391d89a6dafedab1` now persists the
user-scoped deletion job atomically with the request. Focused 16/16,
disposable PostgreSQL 1/1, full serial 846/23/0, typecheck/schema/migration/
build/diff checks pass. Hosted checks were pending immediately after push;
`QUAL-WEB-005` remains open and migration `0031` is not applied to production.

The next PR #153 step adds only the fenced job-state adapter at head
`654c78c69a44d7b5aad4733ec7cb364d760b76b0`. It passes disposable PostgreSQL
1/1 and the full local qualification set, but inventory/destructive/audit
methods remain fail-closed. The whole-product goal remains active.
